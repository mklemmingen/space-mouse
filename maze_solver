# file that includes the maze_solver

# it starts in the middle cube of the highest floor in a crater that consist of nothing [pass-through-walls]

# we measure if the mouse has gone out of the cube if it has reached the lowestlevel -1 and
# gained the status has_finished that ends the while-loop

# the mouse has the strong urge to go to the lowest level of the maze, since 1. there is infamous
# romulan space cheese down there and 2. in its algorithm of searching for the way, it first checks the 
# southern wall of the cube
