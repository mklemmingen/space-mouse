# space-mouse

3D cube maze solver with visualisation and maze generator

-- space mouse against the borg --

generates a cube of a individual size consistent out of a lot of little cubes with random walls.
The mouse can only pass trough open gates or rare one-way gates. 

The space mouse starts in a crater that was created by a plasma torpedo at the top of the cube.

It looks for an opening and goes straight in, always wanting to go downwards to get to that sweet romulan cheese
at the other side of the cube. 

The visualisation mimics a spy-movie radar, where the cube that the mouse is in is visualised by seeing 
the top-down view of the cube and the front view of the cube - on either one the location is marked with a blinking
red dot. 

enjoy!
